“information asset risk worksheet” introduced in OCTAVE-A framework


This coursework allows you to extend your knowledge and understanding of the use of
“information asset risk worksheet” introduced in OCTAVE-A framework presented during
the lectures. This is a pair-work assignment (2 members). This coursework counts for 30%
of the overall marks for the module.
BACKGROUND
The scenario is as follows, you are being asked to compose 5 critical “information asset risk
worksheets” for a chosen organization. The organization can be an existing company which you
are/were working for, or you may create a made-up scenario. You also have the option of
choosing SLIIT as your organization. However you will not get access to internal technical
information and therefore the components have to be made-up by yourself. Note the scale of the
organization is irrelevant, although your choice of organization will affect the number of potential
threats.
TASK DESCRIPTION
1. Identify potential 5 risk scenarios for the organization.
• Through a thorough assessment of the organization you choose, you are to
identify key critical assets, which can be hardware or software based.
• You should then identify potential threats to these assets.
• Out of these threat scenarios you can choose top 5
2. Complete ‘Allegro Worksheet 10’ for each scenario in ‘1’.
• You should complete one worksheet per scenario you identify
• You should predict ‘probability’ level for each scenario based on a solid
justification. Justification for each probability level should be included in the
Appendix.
• You should assign respective ‘impact’ values for each scenario based on a
solid justification. Justification for each probability level should be included in
the Appendix.
• You should also propose risk mitigation techniques for each scenario (No
need of extensive technical details).
• Include at least 1 mitigation step for each scenario.
• Include references in IEEE Format wherever necessary.(Click here to learn

The following will be considered in the assessment of this coursework:
• The accuracy of identified risk scenarios.
• Justifications for perceived ‘impact’ and ‘probability’ ratings.
• The quality of the proposed mitigation techniques. (Quality being defined as ‘fit for
purpose’)
• Scope and technical accuracy of the overall worksheets.
• The correct use of relevant references to support the arguments you make.
• The overall presentation – clarity of discussion, organization and professional
